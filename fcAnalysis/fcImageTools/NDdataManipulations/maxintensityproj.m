function [proj] = maxintensityproj(I, ndir)
% Maximum intensity projection along one dimension given by ndir of a 
% 3D image
% Input Parameters:
% ----------------
% 3D Image
%%Example usage:
% -------------
%%Projection along XY plane
% Ixy = maxintensityproj(I, 3);
% figure, imagesc(Ixy);
%%Projection along XZ plane
% Ixz = maxintensityproj(I, 1);
% figure, imagesc(Ixz');

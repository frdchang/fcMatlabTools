% This function uses the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to recover phase.
% Propagates guessed phase to multiple planes upon each iteration. To
% illustrate, suppose we have a stack of images [Mn ... M1 C P1 ... Pn].
% Then during each iteration, the center image C will be propagated to 
% planes P1 ... Pn, and the results will be replaces with their respective
% measured intensities. These will all be propagated back to the center,
% where we take the measured center intensity and the average of the phase
% results. Then the process is repeated for planes M1 ... Mn. This
% completes one iteration.
%
% Inputs:
%   - Inten:    Stack of intensity images
%   - I0_idx:   center image plane index in stack
%   - zvec:     vector indicating z values for images in stack
%   - num_imgs: number of images to use on either side of the center plane
%   - ps:       pixel size
%   - lambda:   wavelength
%   - N:        number of loops to perform
%
% Outputs:
%   - phi:      phase matrix corresponding to intensity at center plane
%               recovered by the algorithm
%
% Notes:
%   - INPUT IMAGES [I0, I1, I2] MUST OF EQUAL SIZE. 
%   - The units for ps, lambda, and dz MUST BE CONSISTENT.
%   - dz is the distance between I0 and I1, should be the negative of the
%     distance from I0 and I2
